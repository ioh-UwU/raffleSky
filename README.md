# raffleSky

by [@iohtheprotogen.art](https://iohtheprotogen.art)

Project files (minus testing environment variables ofc) for a web app I'm working on to host highly customizable raffles on Bluesky posts.

This will eventually be published to a webpage when it's done! Making the repository public for transparency while I make it.

_Uses Node.js and Vite_
