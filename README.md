# ioh's Bluesky Raffle Utility
Project files for a web app I've made for hosting highly customizable raffles on Bluesky posts. <br>
_Uses Node.js and Vite_

To use the site, simply enter the link to the post you're running your raffle on and set your configuration options. <br>
If available, more options related to each parameter will become visible as they are selected. <br>
Raffles may be exported to be reused later.

## Plans for New Features
* âœ… Options to import and export configurations and full raffles, including chosen and rerolled winners. <br>
* âœ… Mobile layout improvements.
* ðŸ”œ Options for required content in candidate comments.
* Option for minimum account age.
* Options for minimum and maximum follower/following counts.
* Regex support for all text filters (blocked users, host and candidate comments, and any additional fields).
* Options to configure bonus entries.
